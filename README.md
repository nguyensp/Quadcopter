This is a continuation of my senior design project.
Jonathan and Luis created the schematic and produced
a workable board. Rishita and I proudced a working
flight controller that generated proper motor adjustments.
We finished just short of test flight before our final
presentation and graduation.

I've decided to finish the project refactoring and adding
new code that will allow flight and in future developments
programmable autonomous gps flight paths and a camera
for first person view flight experiences with a controller.

This is a work in progress. Old files will be put in a separate
folder for reference.
